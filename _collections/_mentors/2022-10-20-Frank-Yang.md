### About

I'm just a BS/MS student with just a couple of quirks and a troll irl. I like to think I'm pretty down to earth and some of my hobbies are being active and making things. 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

Because Sarah told me to.
Jk, I'm happy to show people the ropes of this school, have fun, or help you in your academic endeavours. 

### Career Goals

Looking to do some work in aerospace or just make some cool toys for the government. 

### Co-ops

Materials Sciences LLC.
L3Harris

### Interests

I love making random stuff like food or building models - lego type energy
Hard cardio
Learning random things
Martial arts fanboy
Rambling
Listening to rnb

### What to Expect From Me

I honestly don't have a plan, but I'm pretty flexible. I still know good thing or two in your STEM classes, coop, or if you just someone to hang with. You'll probably hear a lot of jokes from me that make crickets chirp.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

We will just be chill like that.
