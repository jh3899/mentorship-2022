### About

I'm a slightly introverted, cat-obsessed girl who sleeps too much. I'm happiest when I'm hanging out with my friends but I also enjoy recharging my social battery and being a homebody from time to time. If you send/show me cat photos, I'm instantly your friend. 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I know what it's like to enter college feeling lost, but through SASE I was able to find a lovely mentor and meet many people that made me feel welcome here. Having a mentor that can give you insight on how to navigate college is valuable; I hope to be that person for someone. 

### Career Goals

Not too sure but I'm definitely going the UI/UX design route. Maybe I'll end up tormenting developers with my wack website/app animation ideas. Designing UI for video games sounds really cool as well. 

### Co-ops

None

### Interests

I really enjoy being creative: video editing, animation, motion graphics, painting, drawing. I also indulge in anime/manga and enjoy collecting figurines, pins, manga, etc (there's a lot of little trinkets I like to decorate my room with). I listen to a lot of indie, pop, lofi, and r&b music but would love some new music recs!

### What to Expect From Me

I can be someone they come to for academic/professional advice or just someone to chat about personal interests with. I'm always available through text and it would be fun to hang out on campus, grab food/boba, and have study sessions! On the off chance that they're in the same major (UXID majors are so scarce please), I'd be able to guide them through some classes. 

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

Whatever my mentee is comfortable with, but I hope we can become close friends where we can learn a lot from each other. I'd envision a friendship in which we can casually talk about anything but also focus on academics/career when needed.
