### About

Very casual person. I mostly spend my time playing games, reading, and watching anime. I like to consider myself decently organized since I do schedule my workload, but freetime is wherever the winds take me.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I would to meet and make new friends as it will be my first year here. I also think it would be fun to help and give advice as someone who has already gone through their undergraduate degree.

### Career Goals

Going into industry to do R&D in semi/superconductor technologies. Maybe a PhD later in life.

### Co-ops

None

### Interests

I love Arknights and SDVX and I am currently playing AQW again. Looking forward to Nikke and Limbus company when they release later this year. 

### What to Expect From Me

Most likely help with classes I can help with, potentially give advice on general undergraduate studies/be a mini advisor. 

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

Friends who complain about the hardships of university life, both undergrad and grad. Also someone you can atleast confide with.
