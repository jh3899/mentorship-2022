about: Hello hello, I'm Sophia!
I'd consider myself a pretty easygoing and chill person, but I'm also spontaneous and love to hype people up. Mindset-wise, I do quite a bit of introspective thinking and reflection, and I'm always trying to improve myself as a person. 
Chilling and going out to eat is always fun, but I do also want to touch more grass, so I'm always down to try something new :)  
year: Sophomore

### About

Hello hello, I'm Sophia!
I'd consider myself a pretty easygoing and chill person, but I'm also spontaneous and love to hype people up. Mindset-wise, I do quite a bit of introspective thinking and reflection, and I'm always trying to improve myself as a person. 
Chilling and going out to eat is always fun, but I do also want to touch more grass, so I'm always down to try something new :)  

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I really adore my mentor (Shirin Chong!!! :D) and the mentorship program helped me get more involved with SASE and the community in general, so ideally I'd be able to get to know people better and help someone out too!

### Career Goals

Make good money and have a good time TT

### Co-ops

Bristol-Myers Squibb

### Interests

I like music, learning, and getting to know people--I have a slight boba addiction, so we can chat over boba and I'm always down to get into a new hobby! I've been into a lot of things (e.g. webcomics, anime, kpop, art, games, books, etc.), so anything is cool.

### What to Expect From Me

Freeeeee therapy, good vibes, and any help that I can give in general--even if I'm busy or working, I'll do my best to make time for them. Mentorship can be whatever they'd like it be!

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I'd like to be part of their support system--someone my mentee is comfortable turning to if they need help or advice, and also be a friend beyond the mentorship program :) They can message me whenever, about whatever, and we can chill, study, or hang out (whatever they want to do lol)
