### About

Hey, I’m Alan and I am a Philly native. I might not exactly be the one to initiate conversations but I would love to get to know you. I’m a pretty out doors person but also play games occasionally. If you see me, feel free to say hi.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

Cause why not?

### Career Goals

Retire Early

### Co-ops

Real Estate, Executive Search

### Interests

I like skating, biking, playing games, and eating spicy food.

### What to Expect From Me

We could hang out, explore the city, and talk about the Drexel shaft :)

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I think it would be fun to have a laid back relationship. I want to be there if you need help with anything but I don’t want it to be overly professional.
