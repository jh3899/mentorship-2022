### About

I would say I'm pretty detailed oriented, light hearted but I can be serious if needed to be...I would also say I'm a pretty good listener, diligent, and I have a good sense of humor. Otherwise I'm unsure how else I would describe myself 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I want a be a SASE mentor because I love to help others out & be of support to them. I may have just joined this organization but as an Upperclassman I know underclassmen are definitely struggling and want help but are afraid to do so. I have some trial & error experiences that I would love to pass on to mentees. Also to help them be more comfortable & if they need a someone to go somewhere, I'd be happy to be of a assistance.

### Career Goals

I will be honest, I am unsure of what my own career goals are. However, I do know that in whatever I do I want to be able to help others. 

### Co-ops

Door-to-Door sales & DragonsTV editor (for WWB)

### Interests

I love photography, playing video games and, listening to music. I also love to watch movies & anime! I love to take random adventures as well. I love food & boba so I will always say yes to getting food.

### What to Expect From Me

As i've stated, I'd love to pass down some advice I have from trial and error. I would check up on them, seeing how classes are going, if they need help studying, or just need a friend to talk to. As for the studying, I could give tips & tricks on how to best study or stay organized.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

As an upperclassman that they can go to if they need advice or help but also as a friend.
