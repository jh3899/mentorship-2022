### About

Hey! I am Harshil and I am a pre-junior majoring in Software Engineering and minoring in Technology Innovation Management and Data Science. I can be quiet and introverted at first but I feel like I am pretty outgoing once I open up.I like to travel and explore new places and have visited many different countries. 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

When I first joined SASE, I was very lost. It was a very big organization and so many members that, for me, it was overwhelming. I remember how big of a role my mentor played to help me feel included by helping me connect with other members as well as giving advice on classes and professors. I want to join the mentorship program so that I can help new incoming students to assimilate in this fast-paced and busy environment and help them to get the most out of Drexel and SASE. I feel that with the 2 years of experience I got as part of Drexel and SASE gave me the ability to be a great asset for my mentee. 

### Career Goals

My career goal is to be able to find a career where I am able to apply my analytical and creative skills on my technical and hard skills and to be able to impact the industry. I would either like to be somewhere in software design or architecture or find some friends to start a start-up in tech. 

### Co-ops

IBM (Client Solutions Engineer in AI Applications)

### Interests

My personal interests are hiking, biking, rock climbing, and exploring new places. My academic interests are artificial intelligence and computer vision. I also have gained recent interest in business and how AI can be used in private equity and asset management. 

### What to Expect From Me

I will try to be as resourceful as possible and will try to help my mentee easily assimilate in this new environment. If they have personal or career goals, I can help guide or advice course of actions so that they can achieve them. I will also give constructive feedback on their progress to help guide them to where they want to be.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I feel like our relationship will be very causal and friendly. We can meet on a weekly basis or whatever my mentee sees fit. We can discuss about any concerns or advice they might need and their progress towards their goal.
