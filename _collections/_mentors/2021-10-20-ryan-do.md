about: Positively, a seasoned veteran at getting rejected. Because no matter who says no, the next job will always come around. Jokes aside, I am a college student with many ambitions, be it voice acting, investing, and more. I can be a listening ear, a comrade to show your stuff to, or someone to chill with. I'm a jack of all-trades, just letting the river of life take me where I'm already headed.

### About

Positively, a seasoned veteran at getting rejected. Because no matter who says no, the next job will always come around. 
Jokes aside, I am a college student with many ambitions, be it voice acting, investing, and more. I can be a listening ear, a comrade to show your stuff to, or someone to chill with. 
I'm a jack of all-trades, just letting the river of life take me where I'm already headed. 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

Mentees are full of potential and direction. The issue can be that too many options exist. A reality check that mentees need is that they can put so much time into their future that they forget their present, to have fun, to BE themselves. I've done that twice to myself, back in HS and in college (pre-COVID). I also provide a lax nature that some mentees may find comforting, idk. At base case, I can provide a helpful ear for venting. 

### Career Goals

Major-wise: Something Security-related (most security jobs require past experience), such as analyst, or a physical penetration tester. 
Realistically, I'm fine with IT as well. Just computers in general. Hands-on with computers is ideal.
Outside of school: full-time voice actor and streamer - making my own hours and such. But paying back my loans may become a bit harder. 

### Co-ops

Drexel University - Audio/Visual Assistant |
Morgan, Lewis, & Bockius LLC - Desktop Engineer

### Interests

Games, voice acting, movies, DnD, Computers, memes, you name it. You got a hobby, I'm probably interested. 

### What to Expect From Me

Being a helpful ear, telling them resources to use to navigate this world of jobs, and to enjoy down time. Because it is something you do not get enough of. I just pray their major isn't too hard, since I can only help so much lol. 
Besides that, I can be that dumb older friend who vibes. 

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

Friendly, I'd def prefer it if they had more energy than me since I cannot carry a mentee who has the same tired energy as me. 
Again jokes aside, things can go pleasantly, I don't see how things can go wrong if we communicate and are chill.
