### About

You will know me when you know me 😁✌🏻

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I was a mentee 2 years ago and received a lot from my mentor. Now that I am further along my academic and professional career, I wish to be a mentor to give back to the community. I want to help my mentee in any way I can, or just be a buddy to them through their Drexel journey.

### Career Goals

Some role in a company that is involved in the global market. To be honest, still figuring things out.

### Co-ops

Baltimore Gas & Electric, an Exelon company

### Interests

Sleep, waiting to unlock more interests

### What to Expect From Me

I plan to mainly just be there for them when they need 😊 Be a friend. I hope to provide advice as requested about academics or professional career. If I don’t know something I’ll search out what resources I can provide them. ~Going with the flow~

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)
