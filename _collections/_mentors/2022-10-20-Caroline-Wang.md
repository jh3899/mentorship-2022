### About

Hi! I am a fourth year biology major from northern California. I am nice and friendly, and I am always open to talk, especially after getting to know someone. I enjoy reading, napping, and watching movies, and I would love to explore more of Philly during the rest of my time here!

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I would like to be a SASE mentor to meet different underclassmen, build relationship with them, and hopefully help them navigate their transition into college life based on my own experiences. 

### Career Goals

I would like to become a physician, and I will actually be starting med school next year

### Co-ops

Clinical Research Coordinator at Jefferson

### Interests

In terms of hobbies I enjoy reading, basic crafts, board/card games, and just doing activities with people. In terms of academic/career interests, I would like to go into the medical field, so I am always open to opportunities for patient contact/clinical experience and research.

### What to Expect From Me

In order to mentor my SASE mentee, I plan on meeting with them to chat or do activities to get to know them better. I will try to check in on them regularly to see how they are doing and see if there are any ways that I can help. I will try to be easily accessible and open to questions. 

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I hope my relationship with my mentee can develop into a nice friendship where we feel comfortable talking to and sharing with each other.
