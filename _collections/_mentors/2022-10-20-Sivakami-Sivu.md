### About

I am from California and have never been to the east boast, which is very prevalent. I love music, dance, anime, books, and exploring. 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I want to be able to work with others on different activities and experiences, I feel that it would be a good bonding experience especially being new here.

### Career Goals

I hope to one day work At Stanford children's hospital in a high role, maybe chief of surgery but that is just a little out of reach. 

### Co-ops

None

### Interests

I love to crochet, watch anime, read, go shopping/out with friends even just do errands. 

### What to Expect From Me

I plan to be there for them when they need or want help with different academic or life problems. If they are looking for advice or just someone to try out new things with. 

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I want them to know that  I am someone they can rely on and someone that they can come to trust and ask for advice.
