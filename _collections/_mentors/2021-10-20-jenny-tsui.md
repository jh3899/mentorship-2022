### About

Although I am an introvert, I try to push myself out of my comfort zone to be more social and talkative to others! I love doing spontaneous things, eating, and also having a night in. I'm super openminded so I am down to do anything (as long as it's not illegal)!

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

As a 3rd year, I feel like I have gotten comfortable and knowledgeable about Drexel and being a college student in general! I also would love to give advice and connect with some underclassmen since it's also been a while since being in-person again so this mentorship program will be great to meet new people! 

### Career Goals

I hope to become a registered nurse after I graduate and I have an interest in working in pediatrics! I would love to work with children and help them recover. After working a couple of years, I hope to go back to school and become a pediatric nurse practitioner!

### Co-ops

University of Pennsylvania Student Health Center

### Interests

Some of the things I love to do with my free time is reading, running, hiking, eating, and being outside! I love walking everywhere to get my cardio in and also explore Philadelphia! I am passionate about food, helping people, and bettering myself each day! 

### What to Expect From Me

I hope to offer them any answers to questions they have when it comes to Drexel, co-op, life in general, etc. Besides just being a mentor, I would like to build a friendship so it is also fun for them and eat good food! :)

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I hope to be someone they can always go to when in need of some advice or just to be someone for them to talk to. I also hope we'll be able to talk freely about personal things and have a good relationship so they feel supported!
