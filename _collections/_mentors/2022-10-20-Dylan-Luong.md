### About

I would describe myself as ambitious, quiet, and kind. I tend to laugh at just about anything and everything I say (not because I think I'm funny, at least most times lol oops). I am an INFJ-T personality type, so I tend to be shy, but I love getting to know people!

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I am already a SASE mentor to two ~wonderful~ mentees and have really enjoyed the bonding experiences with them through the mentorship events. I also personally find it rewarding to help underclassmen with anything that they need and hope to have the opportunity to continue doing so.

### Career Goals

To get the bread. Or at least be able to afford bread. Tbh my career goals are pretty open-ended, as I am a triple major and therefore very indecisive (in general really). My main goal is to find a career that I enjoy doing and hopefully be able to make my parents proud :')

### Co-ops

Finance Co-op with KKR
International Finance Co-op with Chubb

### Interests

There's probably two things in this world that I can talk about for hours: basketball and marvel. Other than that, I like staying active and going to dac at 7am everyday to work out. I like to find new ways to express my creative side. In the past I've tried writing, making youtube videos, and even painting. Currently I enjoy taking photos, specifically food photography because I have also been trying to cook more often. @khangalow on insta aha ha...

### What to Expect From Me

I plan to be there for my mentee 24/7 for anything that they need. Granted I may not be the type of mentor to hangout with their mentees every week, but I am very good at checking my messages and love answering questions that my mentees may have about literally anything from academics to extracurriculars to professional advice. I do my best to keep up with my mentees, but I like to let them take the wheel.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I like to keep the mentor-mentee relationship very lowkey. I'm usually not one to schedule things with my mentees frequently because I recognize that everyone has things to do. I prefer to keep in close contact via texts every so often and overall let them decide if they would like to hangout, go to events together, etc.
