### About

I am introverted but I do like to socialize. I care a lot about friendships and would do anything in my power to help a friend out. I honestly like to hang out with others whether we are studying or just casually chatting. 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I think this is a good opportunity to continue Kathy's line. Just kidding...but maybe... I think mentoring others can help me as well as others. Becoming a mentor can help me see my own shortcomings in terms of leadership and communication skills as well as my interpersonal skills. 

### Career Goals

Work in a hospital setting first and accumulate experience then go back to school to get a MSN. 

### Co-ops

Gift of Life Donor Program

### Interests

Bullet journaling, watching dramas (Chinese, Korean, English), hanging out (going to a movie, eating out, or a boba date), shopping

### What to Expect From Me

Professionally can be using my connections to help my mentee. I also do want to be a friend with my mentee. 

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

As friends or a source of professional help.
