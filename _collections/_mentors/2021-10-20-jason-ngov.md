### About

I'm Chinese-Cambodian and extremely passionate in building people and organizations in my community. I love experiencing new cultures and spend majority of my free time venturing through the city for new places to eat!

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I believe mentorship is extremely important in navigating through college and life in general. My mentors have helped me push boundaries professionally and personally. I want to give back and continue to be a helping hand to the the younger generation of SASE undergrads.

### Career Goals

My goal is to be an industry leader in tech working on initiatives that help build underrepresented communities on a global scale. 

### Co-ops

Mobile Applications Developer @ Pfizer, SWE Intern @ eMoney Advisor, SWE Intern @ Susquehanna International Group

### Interests

The pandemic really allowed me to explore many different hobbies/interests, but the ones that survived are: reading, 80s music, working out, building tech apps, and salsa dancing (v badly)

### What to Expect From Me

I want to be a point of contact for my mentee and be someone they can lean on for questions or support. Whether it's prepping for COOP interviews, help with classes, or just hanging out, I want to be able to invest in my mentee and help them reach their short and long term goals. 

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

Casual friendship where we can learn and grow from our experiences together.
