### About

I am a lighthearted, goofy, and ambitious guy that loves to do just about anything!  I've been told that my social battery has no upper bound; so if you want to hang out at any time of day (and maybe see me embarrass myself), come say hi!

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I'm both a social and caring guy that loves sharing his experiences and time. I'm hoping that being a SASE Mentor will provide me an experience where I can use these qualities to provide a mentee with advice while also being a very casual friend.

### Career Goals

Ultimately, I aspire to be a neurosurgeon. Given that that's quite a long road to travel, I also hope to involve myself in various research opportunities along the way, preferably in projects that have an impact on society, and also expand my scientific skillset.

### Co-ops

Research Technician at Integral Molecular

### Interests

My hobbies include playing music, sports (tennis and volleyball are my main, but I always love trying new things), dance, and struggling to be a photographer. I also enjoy messing around with home science experiments, as I have a microscope at home!

### What to Expect From Me

I plan to hang out with them in whatever capacity they'd like, whether it be brunch, boba breaks, or something sporty! This means that sometimes I'll be sitting down with them to talk about co-op opportunities, class scheduling tips, and other academic facets, but also mix in some activities that are just plain fun and recreational, because fun is important!

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I'm hoping to have a flexible relationship with my mentee! We'll hang out just as friends do, and deciding when those hangs will happen will simply be up to conversation. If you want to grab boba and talk about interview tips next week, or meet up to play tennis tomorrow morning, just ask! A balanced lifestyle is important to me, so I'm aiming to be just as much a companion as I am a mentor.
