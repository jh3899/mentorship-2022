### About

I’m a 4th year CS major who has professional E-Board experience....but I know how to have fun too (no not just touching grass). I love some spontaneous quality conversations over food/drinks, but I also like binge-watching shows in a burrito blanket. I'm also in Prism, Drexel's K-Pop dance team.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

Becoming a SASE Mentor allows me to give back to the community that has changed my college career for the better. It also allows me give another person the tools to succeed not only professionally, but also as a person who grows and nurtures their interests. 

### Career Goals

I hope to get a Master's Degree, a Software Engineering job after graduation, and be fully financially independent all while creating quality friends and relationships along the way. I also have a long term goal of being able to speak Mandarin, Japanese, and Korean in case I travel by myself ✈️

### Co-ops

1st Co-Op:  Data Integrations Intern at Agilence, Inc.
2nd Co-Op: Software Engineer at Lockheed Martin

### Interests

I like to cook when I get the chance to, reading self-improvement books, and immersing myself in Asian culture (mostly Korean right now). I also love to drink coffee and bubble tea, and going to concerts for my favorite artists. 

### What to Expect From Me

I hope to provide my mentee with opportunities to grow personally and identify what their passions are outside of educational motives. I want to cultivate a close and friendly connection with my mentee and make sure they have great potential to pursue whatever they want. 

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

If you get me as a mentor, I will be there for YOU. Need advice on life? A study buddy? A boba date? Someone to vent to? I'm only one call or text away. I hope to be great friends with my mentee as they grow confidence in their abilities and their fearlessness to whatever life decides to throw at them.
