### About

I am originally from Northern California. I am more on the introverted side, but I would say I am nice and friendly, and I am always open to talk, especially after getting to know someone, and meet new people. I like reading and playing with my dog, golden doodle. 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I would like to be a mentee to build a meaningful relationship with my mentee and help guide them through adjusting to college and life at Drexel by helping them academically, professionally, or socially using my past experiences. 

### Career Goals

I would like to become a doctor in the future, so I am in the BS/MD program and will go to DUCOM when I graduate. I am still not quite sure what specialty I want to pursue, so I am exploring the different options. 

### Co-ops

None

### Interests

I like reading and watching movies. I am also looking to get more clinical research experience, which I am interested in exploring. I am also a certified EMT and have some experience in BLS transport, which is pretty interesting and fun.

### What to Expect From Me

I plan to mentor my mentee by meeting with them and checking in on them regularly to see how they are doing and help answer any questions they may have. Additionally, I would try to introduce them to any opportunities that I know about in their major or areas of interest, and try to connect them with other people that can also help or give them new opportunities. 

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I would like to have a fun and open relationship with my mentee where we feel comfortable  having different conversation and hanging out with each other.
