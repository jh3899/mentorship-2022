### About

Hihi! My name takes after the TV show "Sabrina the Teenage Witch" ( ☹ I sadly learned that recently actually). I am Chinese-Cambodian - born in Philly but moved around a lot growing up. I'm a pretty social and open person, love having conversations from the most random to the deepest ones. 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

College is a time where we experience a lot of things and learn more about yourself. I want to be some kind of support to my mentee if they have any questions or need advice. Not only do I believe I will learn from mentoring someone, but be there as my mentee grows

### Career Goals

I've learned a lot from switching my major so many times. There are a lot of things I want to do with my career, so I am exploring it! At the end of the day, I do want to work on something I am happy with doing, and have the things I create be loved by the community!

### Co-ops

Python Developer at eMoney Advisor

### Interests

I really enjoy video-editing and photography since I've been getting back into it! I also like to journal, cook, and bake (maybe I'll whip up something for you one day *wink *wink). As for what I like to watch, it's kind of all over the place from kdramas to anime to mystery recap on youtube, and even crime documentaries LOLOL

### What to Expect From Me

I'm pretty chill and up for most things :) Whether it's doing work together, hanging out, or just talking :)

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I want to be both a mentor and a friend to my mentee. If you ever need advice about navigating through Drexel, your career, or even non-school related things, I will offer my best support! I just wanna be someone you can be comfortable and joke around with :)))
