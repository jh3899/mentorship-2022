### About

I'm a pretty shy person around people I don't really know that well. However, I think I'm pretty sociable one I get to know others and around people I'm comfortable around. 

### Career Goals

I want to live a comfy life with a decent amount of money, hanging out with family and friends whenever I can.

### Interests

I like watching anime or dramas, but I haven't been watching as much recently. I enjoy playing valorant, genshin impact, cookie run, minecraft and rhythm games from time to time.

### Looking For

I think it would be pretty cool to have another friend to talk to or hang out with. It would be nice to find someone in the same major as me so if I ever need help, I could just ask them, but it's not necessary.
