### About

Hi, I'm Michelle and I'm currently a freshman! At first impressions, I can be pretty quiet/introverted but once you get close to me, I have a habit of not shutting up about random things. I love cats a little too much. In my spare time, I'm always talking with friends or crying over anime for no reason. 

### Career Goals

I'm not entirely sure which direction I want to head yet. I've been considering optometry but I've also had a few crises about my major already and it's only been one month into school lmao. 

### Interests

My hobbies include drawing, painting, and video editing if I'm feeling creative (which is once in a blue moon). I love anime/manga and I'm always open to any recs. Some of my favorite music artists include keshi, Joji, Rich Brian, NIKI, etc. 

### Looking For

I'm looking for a genuine friendship where we can feel comfortable around each other and talk about anything- whether it be academic related or something completely random. I can also be very lost/indecisive sometimes so someone who can guide me and give me academic/career advice would be amazing.
