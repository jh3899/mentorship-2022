### About

Hello, my name is Andy Nguyen and my pronouns are he/him/his. My application is already a good starting point of who I 'am as a person. So, I'll say the things, not on the application. I'm treasurer for DragonsRun, chess player for the Drexel chess team, and member of Drexel AI. I love creating software and figuring out logic puzzles. I also like to write and read and watch youtube/Netflix as any other person would. I'm doing the 3 co-ops 5-year program for CS and I cannot wait for my first co-op job.

### Career Goals

My career goals include creating different socially impactful organizations and businesses to help those in need. For instance, I have created with my partners a website to teach people how to personally budget. I would also like to do research in my field of computer science with Physics applied.

### Interests

I'll just say what I put as I was describing myself. I like to run, code, study math/physics, read, write, play video games (although school keeps me busy), and hang out with friends. My specific interests include learning about software engineering and Artificial intelligence. Other topics include Quantum Computing.

### Looking For

I'm looking for a mentor who can help me with my professional career. I want to talk to someone in my fields of interest so I can learn from them. For instance, learning about writing a really good resume would be a fantastic opportunity that a mentor can help with.
