### About

Hi, I'm Sanjana! I'm a goal oriented person, but I love having fun when I can. Additionally, while I can appear introverted and shy, I love interacting with new people to a large extent.

### Career Goals

I would like to work at reputable company after graduation. 

### Interests

I enjoy making art (specifically drawing and painting), knitting, and baking (when possible). I also like reading webtoons and watching movies. In regards to music taste, I listen to K-pop, bollywood, and indie pop music.  

### Looking For

I'm looking for someone who can give me co-op and job related advice, along with advice about college in general. I also think that it's nice to be able to make a new friend at Drexel.
