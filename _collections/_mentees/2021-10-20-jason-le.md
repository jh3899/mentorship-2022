### About

I am an international student from Vietnam. I am really easy-going and get along well with everyone. I am an active person; I play soccer and a bit volleyball. I am always down for a game night or for travelling haha. 
My favorite country to go to is Germany, and I am learning German right now! 

### Career Goals

Since my major is a bit of both technical and business side, I am looking towards either being a analyst or a data scientist. Software engineering is also on my radar, but I don't like it as much as the other two

### Interests

Academically, I enjoy playing around with databases and getting insights. I would love to learn more about machine learning and AI. 
For hobbies, I really enjoy movies, especially Asian movies("Us and them" is my favorite). I also did Karate for 3 years in highschool, so I love that too.  

### Looking For

I want a mentor who is also chill and dependable. Professionally, maybe it's most suitable that the mentor has experience working at BigTech companies and I can ask them advice on my career path.
