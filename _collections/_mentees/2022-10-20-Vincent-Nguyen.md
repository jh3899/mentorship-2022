### About

I'm a little shy and I have trouble describing myself (like now). However, I'm confident and I like to have fun. I am someone who likes staying in and having fun at home. 

### Career Goals

I don't know 100% yet, but something low stress. 

### Interests

I like kpop, card games, webtoons. I also watch kdramas, but I always tend to rewatch shows rather than watch new ones for some reason. I also like to go out to eat.

### Looking For

Someone I can ask questions to, like questions to what classes or electives I should take etc.
