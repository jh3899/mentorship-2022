about: I’m a fun and interesting person, I promise. I’m a fan of exploring the city, and I’ve gotten lost a few times following historical tours (but I do know some good spots now. Come with me if you’d like to have boba and listen to live jazz in Old City). I say I like archery, but it’s been a year since I’ve shot a bow and it hurts that the only archery range in the city isn’t offering open range yet. Maybe one of these days…

### About

I’m a fun and interesting person, I promise. I’m a fan of exploring the city, and I’ve gotten lost a few times following historical tours (but I do know some good spots now. Come with me if you’d like to have boba and listen to live jazz in Old City). I say I like archery, but it’s been a year since I’ve shot a bow and it hurts that the only archery range in the city isn’t offering open range yet. Maybe one of these days…

### Career Goals

I’d really like to go to med school and become a physician. Also, I’ve just newly certified as an EMT and I’m looking for jobs around here. After working IFT, I’m looking forward to go into 911 or ER Tech (although I know it’s difficult in this area).

### Interests

As for pre-med interests, I’m really into forensic toxicology and one of my goals here is to intern for a Medical Examiner’s Office. I’m currently volunteering for a crisis line so I’d like to learn more about counseling too.

### Looking For

Someone who is down to study with me in any one of the pretty libraries here. Also, having someone to give me tips along my major and/or pre-med track would be really nice.
