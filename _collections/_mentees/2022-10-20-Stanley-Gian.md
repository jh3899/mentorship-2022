### About

I'm just a freshman looking forward to my college years and figuring out the rest of my life. I don't have any real plans for the future, so I'm just living life in the moment for now. I'm "gifted" and pretty smart academically, but I don't have the best street smarts. I'm pretty introverted and it's hard for me to be around large groups, but I'd like to change that (gradually).

### Career Goals

I don't really know where my life is headed. I'm just hoping to be successful and financially stable.

### Interests

Gaming (league and smash mainly, a little valorant and overwatch.) I don't listen to a lot of Kpop (only really BTS) so I'm open to a lot of music recs. Also open to getting into anime.

### Looking For

A good friend. I'm really just looking for someone who I can look up to and learn from. Their gender doesn't matter to me. Someone with similar hobbies would be nice, but I'm also open to trying a lot of new things. An extrovert would probably pair well with me.


Not sure if you could anyway, but do NOT pair me with my sister.
