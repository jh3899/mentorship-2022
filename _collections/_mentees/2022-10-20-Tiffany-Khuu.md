### About

I'd describe myself as someone who is open-minded, adaptable, and eager to learn new things. I also strive to educate myself on social and cultural issues. I like to say that I'm pretty academically able and am goal-oriented.

### Career Goals

A big career goal that I've had is to work in the medical field and improve healthcare and medical services for patient of marginalized groups. This includes BIPOC, transgender people, women, and those of lower socioeconomic status. I want to at least make small progress in helping to improve health equity. 

### Interests

I love listening to music; I am open to any genres and appreciate any and all music recommendations. I also enjoy playing video games, reading, and spend my free time watching shows and movies. 

### Looking For

I think of a mentor as someone who can sort of act as a guide through Drexel, and offer tips and advice along the way. It would also be extremely helpful if they are able to offer academic help (whether it be with studying or class tips), and professional help regarding the different career fields, interviews, etc.
