about: I don't talk too much at first meetings but I don't mind lively conversation or people who talk a lot; I like high-energy settings! I always want to go out and have fun with friends but I also like my personal space to tend to my hobbies. I like to go at my own pace. I'm pretty sarcastic, but I know that doesn't read well a lot, which is why I can seem quiet at first. Sometimes I'm chill, but I can be spontaneous.

### About

I don't talk too much at first meetings but I don't mind lively conversation or people who talk a lot; I like high-energy settings! I always want to go out and have fun with friends but I also like my personal space to tend to my hobbies. I like to go at my own pace. I'm pretty sarcastic, but I know that doesn't read well a lot, which is why I can seem quiet at first. Sometimes I'm chill, but I can be spontaneous.

### Career Goals

Get a good stable paying job so I can come home and laze around. Make enough money for my 7 Chinese girlfriends dream. 

### Interests

Digital art, reading (mostly anything online, manga, webtoons, light novels), mobile gaming (genshin impact for one), kpop girlgroups, animals

### Looking For

I'm currently on co-op so someone who can give me good tips on the campus and eateries, and places to hang. A friend would definitely be nice!
