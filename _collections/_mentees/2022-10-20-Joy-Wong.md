about: I may look calm and collected on the outside but my mind is actually going over 100mph and most likely overthinking about something. An introvert to the world but I can be the most annoying person ever with friends. Sometimes I get random bursts of energy that makes me feel like I can do anything and other times I will simply rot in bed and do nothing. However I love spontaneity and am down to try anything at least once :)) INTJ
year: transfer student pre-junior year
major: B.S. in Nursing

### About

I may look calm and collected on the outside but my mind is actually going over 100mph and most likely overthinking about something. An introvert to the world but I can be the most annoying person ever with friends. Sometimes I get random bursts of energy that makes me feel like I can do anything and other times I will simply rot in bed and do nothing. However I love spontaneity and am down to try anything at least once :)) INTJ

### Career Goals

To make a decision on whether or not to change majors from nursing to computer science, and do well in it. To learn to be more comfortable in social situations and expand my social network.

### Interests

volleyball (& trying out other physical activities), coffee, netflix, Nintendo switch, minecraft, puzzles, k-pop, astrology, spirituality, reading, cats

### Looking For

I'm indecisive so generally I need different opinions/advice from people to make up my mind. I am also looking for a mentor who can motivate me to do work and to put myself out there and socialize more.
