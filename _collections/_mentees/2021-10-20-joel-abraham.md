### About

I’m rather quiet, persistent as hell when I’m actually interested in something, efficient (lazy), just really interested in science and the application of it.

### Career Goals

I just want to get a well paying job that I can still enjoy

### Interests

Science in general (cars, dinosaurs, how something is made/how something works), different art styles (animation/film, music, drawings)

### Looking For

Someone I can just ask questions(particularly stupid things about like school stuff I don’t want to ask others), someone that can help professionally like making a resume and applying for jobs and networking
