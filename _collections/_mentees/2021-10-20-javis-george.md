### About

Hi my name is Javis George. I am fairly introverted and quiet in person, but once I get to know a person I open up more. I would describe myself as a gamer but I tend to focus on one game at a time.

### Career Goals

To get a stable job and continue to progress in that job.

### Interests

I enjoy playing Valorant and recently have been interested in chess. 

### Looking For

A personal/friend relationship. Someone who I can just talk to and chill with. It would be nice if they can offer some advice as well.
