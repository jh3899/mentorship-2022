### About

I might not be tall enough to be a model but my confidence and charisma definitely adds a foot or two. 

### Career Goals

Hot and successful businesswomen in the making

### Interests

Genshin Impact, retail therapy, sushi, boba, wawa, fashion, uno

### Looking For

I would like it if my mentor was someone who was also in the business world and closely related to finance so I can come to them for academic advice. However, that doesn't have to be the case because anyone can advise with general academic questions. Its more important that I get along with my mentor. I would love to make more friends on campus and hopefully they can help me meet other people as well.
