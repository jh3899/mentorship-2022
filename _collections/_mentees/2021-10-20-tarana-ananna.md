### About

Hiii, my name is Tarana and I'm a sophomore majoring in Management Information Systems. I'm usually a bit shy and an introvert, but sometimes I can be a little too talkative. I enjoy playing tennis, going on hikes, and watching anime. Some of my favorite animes are One Piece, Attack on Titan, and Demon Slayer. I also love eating fried food, especially hot, spicy chicken wings. 

### Career Goals

Though I'm uncertain about which path to take, I aim to continue my research and gain knowledge in my areas of interest. Preferably, I want to intern for different companies during my time at Drexel. After graduation, I want to pursue my own projects alongside having a full-time job. 

### Interests

None

### Looking For

I would love to have a mentor who would become my buddy and just give me general advice.
