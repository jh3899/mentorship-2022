### About

I am a relatively relaxed and calm dude that tends to go with the flow. Love eating good food! 

### Career Goals

I know I want to do something with computer programming, but unsure/don't know what I want to do exactly. Short term is just finding a part-time around Drexel.

### Interests

I like playing volleyball, watching dramas, learning Chinese history, keeping up with the Digimon TCG, and reading.

### Looking For

Someone who is personable and able to make me be more social. Someone who is generally in the know about some of the happenings around campus. Someone who is aware of different opportunities (academic, career, social) that could be interesting/useful.
