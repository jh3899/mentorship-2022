### About

I'm a freshie + commuter student from South Philly. I'm also a personal cheerleader for my friends and family.

### Career Goals

I will volunteer at hospitals/clinics and apply to SWE roles in either non-tech or tech companies before my first co-op.

### Interests

tbh I'm a jack of all trades, master of none. I like petting dogs. Also if you need a duo :D -> valorant tag: doctorasian#drazn

### Looking For

I'd like to have a person that could provide a review/editing process for resumes and internship applications, as well as a person that loves to network with others. I'm also open to casual convos about life.
