### About

Hi my name is Jia! I'm third year Supply Chain Management major. I love going out and exploring new things, but are also chill to stay in and watch a movie.

### Career Goals

My goal is to get to know more people while still in college and form more connections. I want to take opportunities of my next two co-op to gain more communications skills.

### Interests

I love to go shopping and thrifting for new things. I also loves learning new receipts and cook for my friends!

### Looking For

Although I am currently third year student, I missed out on joining student orgs during my freshman and sophomore year due to covid. Therefore, I'd like to get more acquainted with the club as a mentee instead of as a mentor.  I'm just looking for a connection who can give career or academic advices to get ready for the professional world. I'm also just trying to be more social and want to meet new people.
