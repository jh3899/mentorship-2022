### About

Hi, my name's Anish. I'm normally a goofy dude who messes around and cracks really dumb jokes that are sure to annoy most. I don't take myself too seriously. I like chilling out and talking about whatever comes to mind. I can be serious when need be, but that should probably be more often. 

### Career Goals

To be honest, that's what I'm trying to figure out. I'm not sure if engineering is for me, but i still want to leave it on the table. I'm thinking about a wide range of stuff like computer science, cyber security, data science, but I'm really just open to try anything in arts and sciences as well. 

### Interests

I spend most of my time turning in late assignments, but besides that, I'm always listening to music, watching youtube, sometimes twitch, reading manga, 

### Looking For

I want advice from a mentor about what my best options are for exploring my career/major interests, since that's my big thing I want to figure out. Also general school advice like strats to get the right classes or professors, making study groups, how viable switching majors is, declaring minors, etc.
