I am a quiet person around strangers but once warmed up I am very sociable. I really like hoodies and having fun but if I have work that needs to get done I like to efficiently do the work as soon as possible.

### Career Goals

I want to aim for a high paying CS related job  as quickly as possible to support my large family. 

### Interests

None

### Looking For

I don't really have a preference but if I had to have an opinion then I would like someone that will help me professionally and for it to be someone that I am acquainted with.
