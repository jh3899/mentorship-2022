### About

Hi, I'm Yoobin. I'm from the Bronx, NY. I'm a freshman at Drexel, but I'm commuting (live about 10 minutes away). In my spare time I like to play and watch basketball, take my dog to the park, rewatch Marvel movies, listen to music (Kanye, Kendrick, Miguel, Mac Miller, etc.).

### Career Goals

Ideally, I want to work as a PT/Athletic Trainer in basketball/any sport, but I would be happy to work as a PT in general. 

### Interests

None

### Looking For

I just want help navigating through Drexel like what courses/teachers are good to take for my plan of study, how to be active on campus, ways to make connections/reach out to the right people, etc.
