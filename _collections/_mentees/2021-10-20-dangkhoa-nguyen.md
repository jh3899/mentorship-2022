### About

Hi! My name is Dangkhoa, and I am a freshmen majoring in computer science. I consider myself introverted and I can get really shy when meeting new people! I apologize ahead of time if I seem cold or awkward around you, I don't mean to. 

### Career Goals

I aspire to discover a career that I'll enjoy. I also want to network better.

### Interests

Some of my interests include reading webtoon/manhua, listening to music(mostly kpop), going to the gym, and playing video games.

### Looking For

I am looking for a mentor that could help me be less socially awkward, someone who can give me some guidance. More importantly, I am looking forward to making a new friend.
