### About

Hello I'm Justin, I'm from mainland China and currently majoring in computer science at Drexel. People think that I am hard to approach, but don't let that get to you. I am always down to have a conversation! Also, I am terrible at texting people so I apologize in advance.

### Career Goals

I would definitely like to see myself as a software engineer that could work with different languages in the future. I also like to dedicate myself to side projects other than my day job.

### Interests

I like to play games a lot, especially genshin. I'm relatively new to the game so some help would be appreciated!!! Besides games, I like to read mangas and watch lowtiergod on youtube.

### Looking For

What I am looking for is someone who is down-to-earth, always willing to chill and relax. I'd prefer someone who is in the same field as me in terms of study, but I'm perfectly fine with others as well.
