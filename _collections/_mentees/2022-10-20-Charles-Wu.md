### About

I'm an international student from Brazil, but my ethnicity is fully Chinese. My parents immigrated to Brazil before I was born so I grew up there. A few qualities about me are that I am a pretty positive person, self-motivated, and career-oriented. A weakness of my person it’s that I’m stubborn, however I see it also as a quality because that motivates me to work hard for what i want

### Career Goals


My career goal, for now, is to be able to get a job on a company that i admire in Canada (mostly big techs). I’m not quite sure specifically about Canada but I want to live there for a bit before deciding if I want to stay there for good. 

### Interests

I enjoy many hobbies but lately the ones that take my time the most are cooking and rock climbing. Besides that, I enjoy gaming, playing the guitar, stargazing, playing basketball, watching anime, and reading. 

### Looking For

What I look for in a mentor is who could help me professionally and academically wise. I would like to have someone that could assist me while I apply for coops and prepare myself to apply for internships externally. I would also want someone that would help me learn more about computer science and programming outside of the school curriculum. I would like to be able;e to consult what I can do better on a personal project or help me find the solution for a problem.
