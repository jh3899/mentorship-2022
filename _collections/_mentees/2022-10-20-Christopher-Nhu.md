### About

my name is chris nhu and i am half chinese and half viet :) i can speak english, canto, and mando! i’m a pretty relaxed guy, and i enjoy to skateboard, do tricks with my (fake) butterfly knives. i’m also currently pledging with Alpha Epsilon Pi, and i’m a freshman that lives in ucross. 

### Career Goals

i want to own my own engineering firm in the future! i’ll start by working at a start up as a mechie 

### Interests

as previeously mentioned, i’m into skateboarding and butterfly knives. other interests i have are music (piano + guitar) and i really enjoy any outdoorsy stuff bc i was in boy scouts for the longest time :)

### Looking For

i’m looking for a mentor that is more casual. i don’t really struggle with classes, and i’m mainly looking for a mentor to pick up something else that isn’t really academic related.
