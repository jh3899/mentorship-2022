### About

A generally low-energy person, but always down to hang out and get snacks.

### Career Goals

I value careers that allow for creative freedom and critical thinking. I think computer science is a really open field that can provide that.

### Interests

I like art and have a soft spot for anything animated. I play Genshin Impact pretty consistently (and I'm a Beidou main if the person reading this plays too).

### Looking For

Maybe someone who aligns with my major and concentration interests. I guess it would also be nice if they happen to commute to South Philly as well, but not really necessary.
