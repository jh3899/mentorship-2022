### About

I am a hard worker and I am consistent with the routine I make for myself.  But I am also a slow learner which sometimes makes me shy away from trying new things.

### Career Goals

Although I am majoring in chemical engineering, I am also interested in possibly pursuing law school.  

### Interests

I like reading webtoons and baking cakes and cookies.  I occasionally play recreational badminton.

### Looking For

I would like someone who can help me with forming better study techniques for math and science courses.  Or someone who could help me navigate engineering in general.  But overall it would be great to have someone who can guide me through the college and Drexel experience and be someone I can turn to for help with anything.
