### About

Hi, my name is Ryen Ling. I am a freshman studying Computer Science and look forward to getting to know you. I originally come from Chester County, PA and am always willing to explore someplace new. I am an academically driven person, striving to do the best I can in classes, but I know the importance of balancing my life with some fun. I always try to make time for activities with friends and am always interested in trying new things.

### Career Goals

Currently, I am still exploring which specific field of computer science I would like to pursue in my career. My main goal centers around finding this specific passion. At the moment, I have interests in back end development and software in the financial sector.

### Interests

Some of my interests include video games, manga, running, working out, golf, and eating and drinking new or old foods (I'm always down for boba tea). I am also always open to trying new activities with a friend.

### Looking For

For my mentor, I am looking for someone who is willing to join me on my college journey. I hope to talk to this person about my experiences and have the opportunity to ask for advice, whether it be academic, career oriented, or life oriented. I also want to go on new experiences with my mentor. I am open to trying new activities, so I would love to continue doing so with another person. As my mentor and I do more together, I hope to make an impact on his/her journey, enhancing both of our college experiences.
