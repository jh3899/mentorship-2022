### About

My name is Jolin Jiang and I'm a CS freshman from manhattan NYC. My ethnicity is Chinese (Fuzhounese specifically) and I can speak mandarin. I'm a bit of an introvert (INFJ). I like meeting new people but I'm just not really good at it. My favorite color is pink and my interests are east asian music (kpop, cpop, jpop, etc...)and genshin. I main Xiao and have been playing since early game! My favorite cereal is corn pop and I put milk first just because it's crunchier. 


### Career Goals

I want to have a job with a good income and work-life balance. I'm not an overly ambitious person but I would like to be able to "succeed" in the field I'm going into, as in do well enough for myself that I can be self satisfied with my life.

### Interests

I enjoy music as a whole, (singing, listening, dancing). I enjoy eating yummy foods, I'll try most things once even though I'm a picky eater. I like watching video essays on topics like fashion, femininity, culture, trends. I also like playing games, though I'm not good at most I'd like to think I'm pretty decent at Genshin. 

### Looking For

I'm looking for both an academic and personal mentor, I want someone who can aid me through college life especially since I'm very new to my major (computer science). But I also want someone I can trust and have fun with. Generally I'm looking for a friend that can act as a big sibling in the matters of college life.
