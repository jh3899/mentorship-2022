### About

I am a freshman at drexel and I major in nursing. I like listening to kpop and dying my hair to destress. I really like fruit teas :) and eating desserts.

### Career Goals

I am thinking of becoming a pediatric or derm nurse but I am open to exploring other fields in medicine. 

### Interests

I like to binge kdramas, anime, and manga during my free time. I also like listening to artists like txt, enhypen, keshi, and eaJ. I also like to sleep a lot and try different foods. 

### Looking For

Not anything in particular but maybe someone who is good at starting conversations because it takes me a while to get comfortable with people(apologies in advance).
