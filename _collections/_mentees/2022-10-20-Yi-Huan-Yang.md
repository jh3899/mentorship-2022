about: I love meeting new people and learning about other cultures along the way, especially through food. I prefer talking face to face over texting, but it is draining as I have a really limited social battery. I enjoy the city for the most part because urban visuals just have my heart but given the chance, I would definitely travel more to experience new things. I’ve recently been getting into hiking and rock climbing (indoors). I haven't been outside of America so it’s always eye opening to hear about the culture and landscapes of other places.

### About

I love meeting new people and learning about other cultures along the way, especially through food. I prefer talking face to face over texting, but it is draining as I have a really limited social battery. I enjoy the city for the most part because urban visuals just have my heart but given the chance, I would definitely travel more to experience new things. I’ve recently been getting into hiking and rock climbing (indoors). I haven't been outside of America so it’s always eye opening to hear about the culture and landscapes of other places. 

### Career Goals

I’m currently a marketing major, but I’d like to diversify my options and am currently exploring graphic design, UXID, and political science. Ideally I’d like to find a well paying job that allows me to be creative but not solely rely on creativity because I would burn out easily.

### Interests

I’m a landscape and object photographer, but I’d love to venture into portrait, editorial, and fashion photography. Food is life, always. I also do Tang Soo Do, a Korean martial art, but I really want to get into Taekwondo or Kickboxing. I love true crime, mystery, and horror, but I’m also down for romcoms and melodramas like You are My Glory and Scarlet Heart Goryeo.

### Looking For

I hope my mentor is someone who is friendly, relaxed, and loves food as much as I do :)
