### About

I enjoying gaming and doing athletic activity like running and wrestling, but I got tier 76 arthritis so I get tired walking up stairs. I have random burst of energy so I can be crazy or extremely sleepy. I also work at Chipotle

### Career Goals

I prefer to get a job that I don't hate going to and meet some people that I enjoy working and hanging out with. 

### Interests

I like watching Kdrama. 

### Looking For

I'm looking for a friend that can help me through this process doesn't matter if it's academic or personal. Both would be great though.
