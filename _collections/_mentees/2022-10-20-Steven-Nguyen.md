about: I am from Glen Mills, PA, which is around 45 minutes from the campus. I came into Drexel because of its excellent co-op and computing program, being in the city of Philadelphia, and navigating an urban campus.
I joined SASE because I want to connect with club members of similar backgrounds, prepare for my future classes and co-ops, and have fun! Besides SASE, I am also a member of ASA, JUSA, and a couple of CCI clubs.
A fun fact about myself is I took Taekwondo from sixth through ninth grade and got a first-degree black belt.
year: Freshman
major: Undeclared - CCI

### About

I am from Glen Mills, PA, which is around 45 minutes from the campus. I came into Drexel because of its excellent co-op and computing program, being in the city of Philadelphia, and navigating an urban campus.
I joined SASE because I want to connect with club members of similar backgrounds, prepare for my future classes and co-ops, and have fun! Besides SASE, I am also a member of ASA, JUSA, and a couple of CCI clubs.
A fun fact about myself is I took Taekwondo from sixth through ninth grade and got a first-degree black belt.

### Career Goals

For my career, I am planning to work in a 9-5 job. I want to have a career that allows me to learn something new everyday and network with others while enjoying my job. I am planning to work in a big tech company and maybe work abroad one time.

### Interests

Regarding my field, I am interested in learning AI and machine learning, going into servers and systems, and further improving my programming skills.
Outside of class and studying, I usually like to watch TV shows, workout, listen to music, eat out, and play games and the piano.

### Looking For

I am looking for a mentor that could give helpful advice on succeeding through my classes and prepare for my future co-ops. Whenever I struggle with my classes or am not getting where I expect myself to be, I would like my mentor to advise me with these issues. Regarding co-op, I would like my mentor to give me tips on preparing for co-op positions, tell them about their co-op experiences, and how to get into a dream co-op company.
I am also hoping to learn what it is like being a SASE mentor and what their everyday duties are.
