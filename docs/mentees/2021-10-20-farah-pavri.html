  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>I am the first in my family to go to college in the US. I have worked on many engineering projects through school (which include a cardboard boat, cardboard chair, balsa wood tower, and high-speed rail train which was built with foam and magnetics, along with other things). I have many pets and enjoy hanging out with friends.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>I would like to pursue animal prosthetics as a career (from an engineering point of view instead of through medical school).</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I am interested in animals, robotics, engineering, psychology (mainly the part of the brain that controls movements of the body).</p>

<h3 id="looking-for">Looking For</h3>

<p>I would like to find someone who is either working in biomechanics, working with animals but still incorporates their engineering degree into their work, someone who is currently research or creating prosthetics, or someone who is working in some kind of a robotics lab that mainly specializes in robotic arms. It would also be helpful for me to find someone who is working on a project that deals with neurons in the brain and how each neuron affects bodily movement. Such as when so and so neurons are fired, the left pinky is lifted up.</p>
