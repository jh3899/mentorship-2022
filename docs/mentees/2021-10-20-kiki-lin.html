  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>Hi! I’m here to have fun! I would say I’m pretty spontaneous (when not stacked with work) and I don’t usually worry a lot about the small things, just flowing with life. While I personally think that I am a little more introverted, the 16Personalities test did not think so; giving me a ESFP-A.  I’m open minded and willing to try new things :) hit me up</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>In the short term, I just want to learn as much as possible during college (both school-related and adulting). Then land a SWE job right out of college (hopefully, fingers crossed). However, in the long run, I don’t see myself working a 9-5. I would love to travel! Who knows though, the future is never certain :)</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I spend a lot of my time watching kdramas (and slowly getting back into anime for you weebs). If I’m not doing that, I’d probably be periodically switching between YouTube and TikTok. I like working with cameras, doing videography/photography. I’m also interested in personal finance, tech, and dabble into other new things when it intrigues me. When I’m not at home, I like to be active whether it be going for a bike ride or playing sports.</p>

<h3 id="looking-for">Looking For</h3>

<p>I’m looking for someone who I can have fun with. I’m looking for someone who can show me the ins and outs of Drexel (or do that with me if they don’t also know?) and also drag me out to fun events. While also having fun, I’m looking for someone who can provide me professional guidance if they can.</p>
