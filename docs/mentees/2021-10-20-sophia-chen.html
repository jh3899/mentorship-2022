  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>I’m pretty laid-back and easygoing, but I always try my best in everything that I do. I can be anxious and awkward, but I’m friendly and easy to get along with. I try to be outgoing, despite my introversion. A little spontaneity makes life a little more fun, and I think that being open to other people and trying new things usually makes for a good time. We’re all just people, living our lives :)
A healthy mix of procrastination and perfectionism is my enemy ^^;;;</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>I’m not really sure where I want to go in life right now, but I’d like to be someone competent in my field and be a part of something that makes a positive impact on people’s lives.</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I listen/keep up with kpop casually, and I’m trying to get into gaming (League). I play piano and flute, and I do a little bit of art and writing when I have time. I’m trying to pick up more languages- currently I’m focusing on improving my Chinese.</p>

<h3 id="looking-for">Looking For</h3>

<p>I tend to shy away from starting new things and venturing outside my comfort zone, so it’d be nice if my mentor was someone who could give me a push outside of it. I’d like to be able to ask for advice about how to approach things when I’m lost or unsure, and to learn from them about anything at all, really. But really, I’d like my mentor to be someone I can be friends with.</p>
