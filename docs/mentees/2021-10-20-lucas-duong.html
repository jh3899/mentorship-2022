  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>I’m a freshman who lives right outside of Philly, but I live in Millennium Hall right now. As for my background, I’m Vietnamese and know how to speak, but not how to read or write. I’m a bit of a procrastinator, as you can see by when I submitted this form. I’d say I’m pretty easy to get along with if we have common interests. Though, I’m a bit shy until I meet you and get comfortable around you. I’m passionate about the things I enjoy and I just like to live life to the fullest.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>I either want to go into the esports industry, which is why I’m in finance, or something to do with coding, which is why I’m considering comp sci. I’m not really sure which route to take yet since I’m really indecisive. I probably will minor in one or the other.</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I like watching soccer (mostly the USMNT) and basketball (Sixers). I like going to the gym to stay in shape. I like watching anime when I have time, which hasn’t been often lately. My favorites are Attack on Titan and Fate. I play games, like Genshin and Pokemon. I’m also currently trying to learn piano, keyword try.</p>

<h3 id="looking-for">Looking For</h3>

<p>I’m not exactly sure what I’m looking for in a mentor, but I guess just someone to guide me through college with their own experiences. It would be great to get advice from someone who’s been through the things I’m going through right now and I believe it would give me a better outlook on what to expect and how to succeed. Beyond that, just someone I can get along with easily and see them more as a friend than just a mentor in a program.</p>
