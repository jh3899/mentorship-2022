  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>Hihi! My name takes after the TV show “Sabrina the Teenage Witch” ( ☹ I sadly learned that recently actually). I am Chinese-Cambodian - born in Philly but moved around a lot growing up. I’m a pretty social and open person, love having conversations from the most random to the deepest ones.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>College is a time where we experience a lot of things and learn more about yourself. I want to be some kind of support to my mentee if they have any questions or need advice. Not only do I believe I will learn from mentoring someone, but be there as my mentee grows</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>I’ve learned a lot from switching my major so many times. There are a lot of things I want to do with my career, so I am exploring it! At the end of the day, I do want to work on something I am happy with doing, and have the things I create be loved by the community!</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>Python Developer at eMoney Advisor</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I really enjoy video-editing and photography since I’ve been getting back into it! I also like to journal, cook, and bake (maybe I’ll whip up something for you one day *wink *wink). As for what I like to watch, it’s kind of all over the place from kdramas to anime to mystery recap on youtube, and even crime documentaries LOLOL</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>I’m pretty chill and up for most things :) Whether it’s doing work together, hanging out, or just talking :)</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>I want to be both a mentor and a friend to my mentee. If you ever need advice about navigating through Drexel, your career, or even non-school related things, I will offer my best support! I just wanna be someone you can be comfortable and joke around with :)))</p>
