  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>I’m a pretty big nerd, but I like to think I have a social life. When I need to be, I am hardworking and focused. However, I am a somewhat outgoing person who likes to relax and have a fun time as well.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>I want to be able to support my Mentee so that they can make the most out of their time at Drexel. I want to be able to create a safe atmosphere where they can ask and trust me with anything, while also broadening their horizons to new experiences. At the end of the day, it is also a great way to connect with an underclassman and make a new friendship.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>I would eventually like to get a master’s degree. Profession wise, I would like to find a position where I can code with some independence and freedom, namely in something cybersecurity related.</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>Software Engineer at Lockheed Martin</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I play video games (on Drexel’s CS:GO team) and watch anime (too many to count but ask me for recs!), but I enjoy going out with friends for food or boba (definitely don’t have a problemâ€¦). I like to stay active, namely I’m trying to get more into rock climbing.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>I want to create a close relationship with my Mentee where they can see me as a friend and ask me about anything, whether it be about the academic life, professional life, or social life. We can meet or do stuff often to just hang out and build a friendship that will last past the mentorship program.</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>I envision the relationship to be foremost a friendship. I can provide advice and support as an upperclassman, but we’re still equals. We can spend time together both during and outside of SASE events, getting to know each other and having a relationship that will last.</p>
