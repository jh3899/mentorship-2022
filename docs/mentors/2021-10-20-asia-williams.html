  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>I would say I’m pretty detailed oriented, light hearted but I can be serious if needed to be…I would also say I’m a pretty good listener, diligent, and I have a good sense of humor. Otherwise I’m unsure how else I would describe myself</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>I want a be a SASE mentor because I love to help others out &amp; be of support to them. I may have just joined this organization but as an Upperclassman I know underclassmen are definitely struggling and want help but are afraid to do so. I have some trial &amp; error experiences that I would love to pass on to mentees. Also to help them be more comfortable &amp; if they need a someone to go somewhere, I’d be happy to be of a assistance.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>I will be honest, I am unsure of what my own career goals are. However, I do know that in whatever I do I want to be able to help others.</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>Door-to-Door sales &amp; DragonsTV editor (for WWB)</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I love photography, playing video games and, listening to music. I also love to watch movies &amp; anime! I love to take random adventures as well. I love food &amp; boba so I will always say yes to getting food.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>As i’ve stated, I’d love to pass down some advice I have from trial and error. I would check up on them, seeing how classes are going, if they need help studying, or just need a friend to talk to. As for the studying, I could give tips &amp; tricks on how to best study or stay organized.</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>As an upperclassman that they can go to if they need advice or help but also as a friend.</p>
