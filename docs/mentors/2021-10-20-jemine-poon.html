  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>I’m energetic and friendly and I love getting to know people and really do like being a helping hand to others when the opportunity comes. I’m very passionate about many things, including music, cooking, talking about random interesting topics, life, and my faith. I like to keep my life organized a bit so that I know when I can take a break and relax, usually by watching a good show and eating some good food.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>I personally would have loved to have a guide and mentor my freshman year to talk about college life and how to navigate all the little things that come with it. I was able to get a lot of helpful advice from a lot of older students and friends and that really helped me feel more confident in my future as a college student and to feel like I could do it. So it would be so fun if I could help out another underclassman in the same way so many helped me out my first years at Drexel! Drexel has a lot to offer but it’s hard to navigate sometimes so I’d love to be that guide for someone :)</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>I hope to become a physical therapist in the next few years (maybe in 4 years if I continue in Drexel’s Accelerated Doctor of PT tract!)</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>None</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>Cooking, baking, music (I play the clarinet and piano), having good conversations, exploring the city.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>Most likely through texts and a few in person meet ups, maybe grab some food together. I’m currently in a very busy time (getting shadowing hours, CO-OP job searches, studying for MARC-ACSM College bowl, concert band, etc.) so I may not be able to make many do much in person things, so I’ll probably mostly offer advice.</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>I hope to be good friends and to be able to share my experiences with them and to encourage them on their college journey.</p>
